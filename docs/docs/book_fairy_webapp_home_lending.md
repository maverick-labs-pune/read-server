## **Evaluate a home lending session**

Under development

* Click on a home lending session in the `Pending Sessions` table.

* Evaluation of every student in the classrooms of that session is not compulsory.
* Assign a inventory of a book to student either as `lend` if the book was given to that student or `collect` if that book was collected from that student.

* A `Save` button is provided for each classroom.
* Click on `Save` button to save the evaluations for the student of the respective classroom.
* If the save process was successful, a `tick` icon will appear on every row for which the data was successfully saved.
* After evaluating all the students, click on the `Submit` Button to send the session to the book fairy's supervisor for verification.
* The Session will now appear in the `Evaluated but not Verified Sessions` table on the Home Page
